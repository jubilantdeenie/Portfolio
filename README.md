# Portfolio
A collection of my best for your consideration.

Portland based creative working in software development with education in media arts and animation. Focused on full stack development with an eye for clean front end design.

My skills set includes a solid foundation in the .NET framework, C#, Python, SQL, JavaScript including jQuery and Angular, CSS, and HTML. I have used Git and TFS version control. I have also worked in WordPress.

In addition to my development experience, I have an education in 3d art and animation, utilizing such software as Maya, After Effects, Photoshop, and Illustrator. 

As an instructor at The Tech Academy I have learned to communicate effectively in a development environment. My solid people skills will be a welcome contribution to communications among team members and non technical clients alike.
