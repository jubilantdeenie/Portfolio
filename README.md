A collection of my best for your consideration.

**1. JS-menu-order-mgr**

JavaScript jQuery functional pizza menu and order manager. Menu selection updates price display. Returns itemized receipt for multiple orders. Next step: Bootstrap and basic styling.

**2. Python-check-update-transfer**

tKinter GUI on my final Python 3.6 project at the Tech Academy. Browse to a source folder. Checks for files updated since
last check. Copies those to a selected destination folder and records time of transfer to sqlite3 database.
