# JobBoardMvc

**ASP.NET MVC Job Board Prosper IT Consulting / Software Development Intern MARCH 2017 - APRIL 2017**

This ASP.NET MVC5 project was completed for my Live Project course at The Tech Academy in Portland. As a part of the 15 week software development bootcamp students complete 2 weeks collaborating as a team, attending daily standups, and working from a product backlog. The project I was placed on was meant to be a tech job board app which would scrape employment opportunities from local tech company listings. Our only instruction was to work code first and include user login functionality. 

**My contribution to the project**

Established the initial ASP.NET MVC5 project in Visual Studio including the Identity Framework; initializing the database for user identity and login. Worked code first, using Entity Framework 6. We also developed a method to seed the database with sample JSON data. Did troubleshooting on Team Foundation Server issues in order that the project be passed to future teams. Used Python 3.6 with Beautiful Soup to scrape target sites as JSON.

**My experience on the project and what I learned**

Due to circumstances of timing and schedules in the school, my partner and I found ourselves thrown into the deep end, with little preperation, guidance, or solid understanding of what was expected of us. The scope of the project was just beyond what we had learned in our course materials. We were able to divide up our research and move forward without clear guidance; implementing the Identity framework and spinning up the database by creating an initial user login. Our next step was to seed the database with JSON data representing employment listings. This was a very gratifying accomplishmnet. I learned that I am able to effectively communicate with my peers in a collaborative, creative environment. I enjoyed the process of troubleshooting as a team. A great deal of our project time was spent properly establishing the project on TFS to be passed to future teams. I then moved to scraping data from target websites using the Beautiful Soup library in Python.
